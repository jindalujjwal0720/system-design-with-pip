# Glossary of System Design Terms

## A

- **API (Application Programming Interface)**: A set of protocols and tools for building software applications.
- **Availability**: The proportion of time a system is in a functioning condition.

## B

- **Backend**: The server-side of an application, responsible for data processing and storage.

## C

- **Cache**: A hardware or software component that stores data for faster future requests.
- **CDN (Content Delivery Network)**: A geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers.

## D

- **Database**: A structured set of data held in a computer, especially one that is accessible in various ways.
- **Distributed System**: A system whose components are located on different networked computers.

## E

- **Elasticity**: The ability of a system to adapt to workload changes by provisioning and de-provisioning resources.

## F

- **Fault Tolerance**: The property that enables a system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of some of its components.
- **Frontend**: The client-side of an application, responsible for user interface and experience.

## H

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more machines to a system to handle increased load.

## L

- **Load Balancer**: A device that distributes network or application traffic across a number of servers.

## M

- **Microservices**: An architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services.

## R

- **Redundancy**: The duplication of critical components or functions of a system with the intention of increasing reliability.
- **Reliability**: The ability of a system to consistently perform according to its specifications.

## S

- **Scalability**: The capability of a system to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth.
- **Sharding**: A type of database partitioning that separates very large databases into smaller, faster, more easily managed parts.

## T

- **Throughput**: The amount of data moved successfully from one place to another in a given time period.

## V

- **Vertical Scaling**: Adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine.
